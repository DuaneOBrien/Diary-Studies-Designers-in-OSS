Remember this can be written in the Google form under each question or a word/text doc/video/audio recording download link placed in the appropriate section of the Google form
 or sent to ossdesignerdiaries@superbloom.design

If you’re struggling to find the appropriate google form for the week that you are submitting for then checking [this google word document is the best way to find the link to an active form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9uFvr4q6iRMXdI9MI0dMnspxsKiuNnmkuxqlndynAk/edit).

Please make sure your video/audio is in a shareable format and you have enough space in a cloud drive system before sending the file.

Please make sure to put the week dates in the document/file name as such: Monday 5th of December to 11th of December 2022 or 12.05.2022 to 12.11.2022 along with your initials e.g. EF (for Eriol Fox)

Have a good rest of the week.
