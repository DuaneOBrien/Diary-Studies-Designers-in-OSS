# Diary-Studies-Designers-in-OSS
Funded by OCEAN (vermontcomplexsystems.org) we asked designers to complete weekly diary studies about their contributions to OSS for 10 weeks.

This is where the information for setting up diary studies as well as the anonymised weekly diary reports from designers contributing to OSS will be housed.
