# Ocean Project Diary Entry - Week X

At Superbloom, we’re researching how designers of all disciplines contribute to or work on free and open source software. 

The stories and processes of how designers (that's you!) contribute and are involved in free and open source software are hard to find. Despite how ‘invisible’ design is in OSS, there is a growing interest in OSS technology and projects — and that’s why we’re supporting designers to tell the story of their life in open source.

These diary entries will be made over a 10 week time period in December 2022 through to March 2023.

For questions that are not relevant you can enter 'Not relevant this week' and give a short reason e.g. I didn't speak to any users this week.

## Section 2 of 5
**Your OSS contributions this week**
_Questions about the contribution/work you did this week_

**4. What are the top 3 (or more) tasks you worked on this week as a designer contributing to OSS projects?**

[Long text answer]

**5. What was a single challenge you want to highlight this week being a designer contributing to an OSS project?**

_This doesn't always have to be about the 'design' work - it could be any challenge you've faced this week._

[Long text answer]

**6. What was a single success you want to highlight this week being a designer contributing to an OSS project?**

_This doesn't always have to be about the 'design' work - it could be any success you've had this week._

[Long text answer]

**7. Roughly what types of design did you spend what percentage % of time on and how do you feel about that ratio?**

_e.g. 80% UI visual design 10% communications 10% user research etc. It's possible that you spend 100% of you time some weeks on 'comments/emails/clarification' which is still important to any design work._

[Long text answer]

**8. What tools, softwares or products did you use this week to contribute to the OSS project/tool?**

_This might include non design specific tools as well as design tools._

[Long text answer]

**9. Did any users of the OSS tool get involved in contribution or other aspects of the OSS tool this week or did you speak to any users this week?**

_For example, users might have talked in a communication channel or opened an issue  or you may have done some user testing or asked a user a question etc._

[Long text answer]

**10. Did any of the other people (developers, maintainers, docs writers etc.) in the OSS project contribute to 'Design' in the last week? If yes who are they, what is their primary role and what did they get involved in?**

_You can define for yourself what a 'design contribution' from another community member looks like. Some examples might be:_

_- A developer commented on UI design_

_- A user provided feedback on their accessibility needs in the OSS_

_- OSS community members participated in a workshop/user research insight conversation_

_- Another designer helped with graphics, visuals, UI or user research_

**12. Did you get the time and/or the resources you needed to work on the things you think are needed on this OSS project this week?**

[Long text answer]

[Long text answer]

**14. How do you determine the success (if applicable) to the processes methods and practices you used this week?**

**16. Are there any tools, softwares process or methods that limited you in your contributions this week? How did they limit you?**

_e.g. I tried to share a user research plan outline this week but in a markdown text file people cannot see the sections I needed feedback on clearly so I used a google document which is also difficult as not everyone wants to use google accounts._

[Long text answer]

**17. What are the ‘hacks’ or processes have you tried or used this week to problem solve or reduce time on repetitive or tedious tasks?**

_e.g. I tried to record a video of my design file and the UX flow so that those that want to give feedback can get context along with the file._
