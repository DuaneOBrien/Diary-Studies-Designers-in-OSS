Below is the text we sent to participants post diary studies in order to understand what level of privacy they require for their data.

# OSS Designer diary studies: What details do you want in the open?

As you may know we intend to open up the findings from the designers in OSS diary studies as much as possible so that others in the OSS space (such as funders, other designers, organisations that support design and/or OSS) can understand what designers actively contributing to OSS projects daily/weekly lives are like and where aspects can be improved for all :)

Please let us know by choosing from the options below or writing in your own details what you want redacted/removed from your diary responses (e.g. Organisation names, company names, your own name, your location etc.) and any other considerations we should account for as we make this work open and accessible.

For your reference the OSS designer diary studies already has an open repo on GitHub accessible here: https://github.com/simplysecure/Diary-Studies-Designers-in-OSS 

We hope to not only continue designer diary studies in OSS with future funding but also to deliver the information and findings in different formats in the future such as downloadable reports/documents.

Please complete this form by the DAY of MONTH YEAR.

## How do you want your diary study information's privacy treated?

- [ ] I'd like all references to names, organisations, locations and any other identifiable information redacted/removed completely and heavily generalised.
- [ ] I'd like only my name and location redacted/removed but organisations and project names can remain.
- [ ] I'd like only my name to be redacted/removed (you would be referred to as 'a participant' or 'An OSS designer'
- [ ] I'm happy for you to use any and all information including my name to be open.
- [ ] I would like none of my specific information offered in the diary studies openly accessible in this repo.

## What if I change my mind in days, months or years?

You are able to change your mind at any future date to have your information from the diary studies changed or redacted/removed. 

In order to request this please email OSSdesignerdiaries@superbloom.design with the details of the request and the team will commit to making the appropriate changes within 14 working days.
